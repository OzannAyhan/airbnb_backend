**Project Overview:**

This project is designed to construct the final dataset that includes listing-related data, NLP metrics, and forecasted prices. The data covers the period from 30.09.2023 to 30.06.2024, with forecasts extending to July and August 2024.

All methods and data processing steps are implemented in a Google Colab notebook. The notebook guides you through the necessary steps to prepare the data, generate NLP metrics, and forecast prices.
