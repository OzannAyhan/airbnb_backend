**Project Overview:**

This project is a Python backend application designed to forecast Airbnb prices and analyze current price trends. The application processes data from Airbnb's calendar and listing information, applies NLP techniques to extract important metrics, and uses machine learning models to predict future prices. The processed data is then prepared and served to a dashboard, which provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing pricing trends and insights.

**Features:**

1. **Data Collection:** Fetches and processes calendar and listing data from Airbnb.
2. **NLP Metrics:** Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze listing descriptions and other text-based data.
3. **Price Forecasting:** Implements machine learning models to predict future Airbnb prices based on historical data.
4. **Data Preparation:** Prepares and structures data for easy consumption by the dashboard.
5. **Dashboard Visualization:** Presents the data in an intuitive and interactive format, allowing users to explore current and forecasted pricing trends.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and backend logic.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models for price forecasting.
- **SpaCy/NLTK**: NLP processing of listing descriptions.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: Visualization libraries for rendering graphs on the dashboard.
